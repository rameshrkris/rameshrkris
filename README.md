- 👋 Hi, I’m Ramesh Radhakrishnan @rameshrkris 
- 👀 I’m interested in theoretical physics (Gravity, Modiifed Gravity theories, Field theories (classical, quantum, conformal)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning - neural networks, applications to many-body physics and quantum tomography
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using neural networks for validation of quantum ground states of very large systems 
- 📫 You can reach me via email (Ramesh_Radhakrishna1@baylor.edu)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am trying to see if we can use machine learning in classification problems in Gravity such as Petrov and Segre Classifications of spacetimes
